First milestone project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my  website to present to prospective employers. The portfolio highlights six projects that cover a range of technologies, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form. As I am bilingual, it has both an English and a French version.
