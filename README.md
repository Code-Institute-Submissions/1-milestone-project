# Sajanek ART website
First milestone project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my website where I present my artworks. The website allows the visitors to downloand few of my digital prints for free and leads visitors to my shops in other ecommerce websites where I sell my prints and original paintings. The website is in an English version and it is divided to five sections and covers more technologies. 

## Demo

## UX
I decided for a single scrolling one page website where different sections are separated areas so comming visitors can be orientated very quickly. My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information. The combination of colors was chosen to make a design come alive. I choosed eye-catching color combinations which are balanced with contrasting link colors to bring attention to important components.  

For visitors via a user friendly eye-catching design, I wanted to show a bit of my portfolio with tention to lead them to other websites where they can purchase my art.  

This way, they would be able to see what kind of art I do, who I am and they have option to contact me, sign up for my newsletter in which I present my new artworks and see more art on websites where i sell my prints or original paintings. In five different sections of my website I wanted them to be able to do following:
 
##### 1. SLIDESHOW section 
Here visitors can see cycling images with some of my artworks and captions describing the website.
##### 2. ABOUT section 
In this section I describe a bit about myself so they can access information about what styles of painting techniques I like using, what material I use, what commposition I am interested in etc.
##### 3. PORTFOLIO section 
In this section I highhligt only few of my artworks with possibility of free download and lead people via highlited links to my other ecommerce website where I sell my art.   
##### 4. EVENTS section
Here I wanted to promote my comming gallery exibitions so visitors can see my art in person if they want.
##### 5. SUBSCRIPTION section
Important part of my site is also Subscription section where people can sign up for a newsletter so they can stay in touch with my art.

Links to my social media profiles are also provided for their ease of access.

## Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add e-commerse function so comming visitors can potentialy buy my art on my web so they do not have to be linked to other websites. 
Furthermore I want to also add more of my artworks to Portfolio section.
