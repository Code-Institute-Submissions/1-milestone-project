# Sajanek ART website
### First milestone project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

#### Author: Vladimir Sajanek
This is my website where I present my artworks. The website allows the visitors to downloand few of my digital prints for free and leads visitors to my shops in other ecommerce websites where I sell my prints and original paintings. The website is in an English version and it is divided to five sections and covers more technologies. 

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://vladkosajanek.github.io/1-milestone-project/).


## UX
I decided for a single scrolling one page website where different sections are separate areas, so coming visitors can orientate themselves very quickly. My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information. The combination of colors was chosen to make a design come alive. I choosed eye-catching color combinations which are balanced with contrasting link colors to bring attention to important components.  

For visitors via a user friendly eye-catching design, I wanted to show a bit of my portfolio with attention to lead them to other websites where they can purchase my art.  

This way, they would be able to see what kind of art I do, who I am and they have option to contact me, to see my coming exibitions or sign up for my newsletter in which I present my new artworks and see more art on websites where i sell my prints or original paintings. In five different sections of my website I wanted them to be able to do following:
 
##### 1. SLIDESHOW section 
Here visitors can see cycling images with some of my artworks. Three nice artistic pictures are linked to a carousel so visitors can get a little taste of what I do.  There is also a slider bar at the bottom or on the right and the left side of the carousel to allow the user to navigate through the carousel.
##### 2. ABOUT section 
In this section I describe a bit about myself so the users can access information about what styles of painting techniques I like using, what material I use, what commposition I am interested in etc. Here I also included youtube video of another artist which give the user an idea how I create my art.
##### 3. PORTFOLIO section 
In this section I highligt only few of my artworks with possibility of free download and lead people via highlited links to my other ecommerce website where I sell my art.   
##### 4. EVENTS section
Here I wanted to promote my coming gallery exibitions so visitors can see my art in person if they want.
##### 5. SUBSCRIPTION section
Important part of my site is also Subscription section where people can sign up for a newsletter so they can stay in touch with my art.

Links to my social media profiles are also provided for their ease of access.

## Technologies Use
- HTML5

- CSS3

- Bootstrap (4.3.1)

- Font-Awesome

- Google fonts

- GitHub

- Cloud9

- Chrome, Firefox and Safari developer tools

- Colour picker

## Features
This site uses the navbar feature from Bootstrap with an extra Navbar toggler function so navbar collapses in small screens. The Navigation Bar and Logo is sticky so the users can see a navigation bar all time while exploring this website that also means that they can quickly move to different sections very quickly. 
The users can choose from the following menu items : *** Home About Portfolio Events SignUp ***

Another features which are used in this website coming also from Bootstrap and those are modal components which were used to add an extra information (in ABOUT section) and add options to reserve a ticket for event (in EVENT section).

I also included input validation for the form fields and the email fields.

Portfolio pictures are getting red on hover with the caption in the middle. If the users click on them, they are linked to a new tab where they can download them. 


## Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add e-commerse function so coming visitors can potentialy buy my art on my web so they do not have to be linked to other websites. 
Furthermore I want to also add more of my artworks to Portfolio section. 


## Testing

I was trying to do my website as responsive as possible on different devices. Throughout development I was calling up google chrome devops to test areas like responsiveness and to try and find out what was wrong when things were not working.

If you try to submit the forms or sign up button with an invalid email address there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields in the forms, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload.

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank". All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination. I tested all links which lead to my social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the footer. 

By clicking on the links in the navbar the user will be taken to clicked section. 

This site was tested across multiple browsers  and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, X, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
I have clicked on every item and in every possible order and everything seems to be correct.

I have also exported my code to the W3C markup validation service for testing my HTML file and tried to fix any anomalies or syntax or any notified warnings that were reported.


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. 
In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

## Credits
### Content
All content in all sections on this website were written by me.

### Media
All photos were taken by me from my original artworks, with the exception of the one photo from "Carousel" which was taken from Pexels. A blue filter to carousel photos was applied to preserve the blue-yellow theme.

### Acknowledgements
The navbar toggler function was showed through this tutorial but I used it from [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/#events).

The idea of using modals also comming from code-institute tutorials but found [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/#events).

All used components were after modified to my use.

The media query was tried by me on different screen sizes.

This is for educational use.
